# hello-world
This is my hello world repository to try and figure out how Github works.

I'm Tim kemeling, I'm 24 years old and I'm from The Netherlands.
I currently live in Thailand and work as a scuba diving instructor. 
Due to the pandemic tourism has been really slow so I need to make money another way.
After a 'failed' crypto adventure I landed on coding as a good backup for earning money.
